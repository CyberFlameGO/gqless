## RetryOptions

By default `gqless` has a retry policy of `3` max retries, with a delay of a standard back-off delay `(attemptIndex) => Math.min(1000 * 2 ** attemptIndex, 30000)` ms.

You can customize it this way:

- `retry = false` to disable it.
- `retry = 6` it will retry failing requests `6` times, with the standard back-off delay.
- `retry = true` to use the default `3` max retries, with a delay of standard, a back-off delay.
- `{ maxRetries: 6, retryDelay: 2000 }` for `6` max retries, with flat 2000ms of delay per retry.
- `{ retryDelay: function customRetryDelay(attemptIndex) { ... } }` for `3` max retries with custom back-off delay, and so on...
