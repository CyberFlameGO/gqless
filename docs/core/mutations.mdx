The mutations can be used as regular queries, following the same instructions as mentioned in [Core Basic Usage](/core/basic-usage), but instead of using the autogenerated `query` object, you should use the `mutation` object.

## Example

```ts
import { resolved, mutation } from '../gqless';

resolved(() => {
  const { email, name } = mutation.createUser({
    email: 'xx@xx.com',
    name: 'XX',
  });

  return {
    email,
    name,
  };
})
  .then((data) => {
    console.log('User created!', data);
  })
  .catch((err) => {
    console.error(err);
  });
```
