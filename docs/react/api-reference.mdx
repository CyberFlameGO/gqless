## Fetch Policy

Fetch policies allow you to have fine-grained control over your fetch behaviors

| Name                | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `cache-first`       | Client executes the query against the cache, if **all** requested data is present in the **cache**, that data is returned. <br/> Otherwise, it executes the query against your **GraphQL server** and returns the data after caching it. <br /> <br /> Prioritizes minimizing the number of network requests sent by your application. |
| `cache-and-network` | Client executes the full query against both the **cache** and your **GraphQL server**. <br /> <br /> Provides a fast response while also helping to keep cached data consistent with server data.                                                                                                                                      |
| `network-only`      | Client executes the full query against your GraphQL server, without first checking the cache. <br /><br/> The query's result is stored in the cache.                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| `no-cache`          | Client executes the full query against your GraphQL server, without first checking the cache. <br /><br/> The query's result **is NOT** stored in the cache.                                                                                                                                                                           |
